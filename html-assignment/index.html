<article><h2>About Me</h2></article>

<p>
    My name is Christian, but my actual name is 
    <strong><abbr title="my traditionalist dutch name">Broer</abbr></strong>.
     Not to already confuse the reader, but anyways. 
     I am a <strong>freelance video editor</strong> that works with <strong>motion graphics, digital design, and photography.</strong><br>
     I have been in this business for the past 4 years and have worked with multiple companies and clients.
    Despite this, I believe I still have much more to learn and that is why I am here, taking 
<strong><abbr title="Interacitve Media Design (Co-op)">IMD</abbr></strong> at Algonquin College.<br>
</p>
     
<p>
I have a very small amount of experience with coding, but that is mainly from expressions within <strong><abbr title="Adobe After Effects">AE</abbr></strong>.
 <strong><abbr title="Adobe After Effects">AE</abbr></strong> is my most used program, as I use it for passion work, and professional work.
 Aside from editing, I am also deeply <br>invested in Rock Climbing/Bouldering. 
    Bouldering is a core part of my life, and it is one of my most interesting hobbies.  
    I was also deeply invested in music at one point in my life. I played bass guitar for 6 years,
     <br>during that time I was apart of <strong><em>nine</em></strong> different bands. 
     While in these <strong><em>nine</em></strong> bands, we won many <strong>1<sup>st</sup></strong> place trophies.
      I went on trips with our concert bands, to places such as <strong><em>Banff and Toronto.</em></strong>
     I was also in Jazz bands and Jazz combos,
     we attended many different Jazz competitions, getting gold and silver medals left and right. We also managed to play at Jazz Fest 2019, here in Ottawa.
     I eventually quit music and <strong>dove head first</strong> into video editing.
